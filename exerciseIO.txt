To allow duplicate elements to be stored in a collection, you need to use a list. A list
not only can store duplicate elements but also allows the user to specify where they are
stored. The user can access elements by an index.
Two types of lists are supported: ArrayList and LinkedList. ArrayList is a
resizable-array implementation of the List interface. All the methods in ArrayList
are defined in List. LinkedList is a linked-list implementation of the List interface.
In addition to implementing the List interface, this class provides the methods for
retrieving, inserting, and removing elements from both ends of the list.
